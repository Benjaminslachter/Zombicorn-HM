Game Name: Zombiecorns Harvest Moon
Author: Benjamin Slachter
Main Design Director: Ben's Mom, who came up with the basic premise mostly(90%) on their own.

Discription:
	Most games set in another world say that you are summoned, or you are reborn there after an untimely death. 
	In this game?
	You saw an open portal and on the other side was, oddly enough, a cupcake. A beautiful cupcake, your favorite type!
	And for plot reasons it is even nutrieus and ignores all issues normal cupcakes have(lactose, corn, and other 
	allergies,it is a fictional story it could cure cancer too if I said it did. Matter of fact it cures most problems too.
	And tastes like your favorite food. It is an chocolate cupcake with orange frosting. 
	Sorry Design Director's decition.)
